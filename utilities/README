The "utilities" directory is meant for R scripts that are source()'d on startup,
to make functions or other assets available in the main workspace when loading
the project. All R scripts in the ./utilities directory are source()'d when
the init() function is executed by the user.

- Scripts in this directory must be named
    <learning unit ID>_utilities.R

 - All scripts in this directory must be "clean" in the sense that they
     only define functions or load variables but do not have other side effects.
 - Function names must be specific, to guard against being overwritten by
     other script code.
 - Every function must be preceded by code that announces loading
     to stderr:  message("<unit-ID: loading function <function-name>()")
 - Script files must have the usual headers.
 - Script files must end with a final invocation:  # [END]
 - Refer to ./utilities/BCB410-DataScience_utilities.R for an examples.

# [END]
